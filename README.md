# THIS... IS... JEOPARTY!

## RULES OF THE GAME

It's pretty simple. It's Jeopardy, but a drinking game, so Jeo*party*. The dollar value of each question decides how many drinks the correct answerer gets to give out ($100 is one drink, $200 is two drinks, you get the picture). Unlike real Jeopardy, there's no running tally of points. To buzz in, play flip-cup. Whoever gets it first gets to answer first. You didn't buzz-in first? No worries, keep going if you think that the first person didn't get the correct answer. Up to three people can buzz-in and say their answers.

If you get the question right, give out your drinks as you see fit. If you get the question wrong, take all those drinks yourself like the dumbass you are.

That's really it. There's no final Jeopardy or daily doubles yet because I haven't figured out how to code them in. Maybe I'll get around to it.
